## Freifunk Saar Gluon Modules

This is the repo for our own custom gluon modules.

* gluon-config-mode-dual-vpn: A work-in-progress module to support a firmware with both fastd and tunneldigger, and a UI for switching between the two.
  (Currently deprecated.)
* gluon-filter-ra: Throw away router advertisments from all but the batman-selected gateway.
